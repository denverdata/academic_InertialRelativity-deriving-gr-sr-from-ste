This document captures the core objectives and mathematical principles provided by the author for the discovery that general and special relativity emerge from what we call "inertial relativity". 

## Core Objectives

**Introduce inertial relativity,**: describe its origin and its meaning. Cite universe of light but work through full logic. (see below)
**Special and general relativity are special cases of inertial relativitye**: Demonstrate that General Relativity and Special Relativity emerge from inertial relativity by deriving an equivalence between the three. Cite relevant documents.
**Consider the implications**: This derivation represents a solid and undisputable theory of inertial relativity as the over-arching relativity, of which general and special are edge cases. Explains the natural origin of relativity as we know it. It explains that relative inertia between the observer and the system being observed about the axis of observation across the radius of the plane perpendicular to that axis of observation. That would be a mean radius. That ratio is always the Time-Dialation Ratio, and the Time-Dialation Ratio is always the Inertial Scale Factor, which is the fifth root of the moment of inertia ratio. There are many implications of this discovery. Suggest directions this could be taken. 


## Introducing Initial Relativity

Cite "the universe of light" and "introducing inertial density" papers. 

Inertia is relativistic. Meaning that without a comparator, any measurement of it would have no meaning. Something with a moment of inertia 1e20kg/m would be very difficult to rotate. But not more difficult than something with 1e30kg/m^2. 

From isometric scaling while maintaining constant density (constructive scaling), we know that a system's clock time relative to a static observing inertial frame of reference is proportional to the single dimension scale factor. So, if one takes a uniform sphere of 1 m in radius and 1 kg of mass and scales it up by a factor of two, the resulting system is 2 kg of mass with a radius of 2 m. That larger scale system has a mass that is the cube of the scale factor multiplied by the original mass, and would have a moment of inertia that is the fifth power of the scale factor times the original moment of inertia. Conservation of momentum gives the best representation of how changes in moment of inertia affect motion. So if our sphere were rotating at one meter per second initially, the scaled system would now be moving half of that (0.5 m/s) because of the 2^5=32x increased moment of inertia.

l'=kl where l is the characteristic length of the system, and k is the lineart scale factor
m'= k^3 where mass is m and k is linear scale factor
i'= k^5i where i is the moment of inertia about a selected axis; k is the linear scale factor. 
i_lin' = m' = k^3m where i_lin is linear inertia (mass); k is the limear scale factor.

Because every change in length necessarily changes the systems mass, the first two formulas hold only for strict isometric scaling, the third abstracts mass and radius as moment of inertia. As we know, if we have two systems that share moment of inertia about any axis, than an identical torque applied to each system about that same axis, their respective Delta in motion will be identical, regardless of system geometry that arrived at that moment of inertia; absolutely independent of mass and radius individually. The moment of inertia alone dictates how a system interacts with time about a particular axis. From this, we can conclude the following formula is universal and is not bound in any way to isometric scaling. We demonstrate the validity of the STE herein by demonstrating that general special relativity emerge. from this principle 

**The space-time equivalene (STE)**:

The relative pace of clock time between any two systems about any two select axes will be equal to 5th root of the inverse ratio of the two systems the moment of inertia about the select axes. (universe of light)

t1/t2=(i2/i1)^(1/5) where i is moment of inertia about the axis of observation; t is the clock time of the respective system system 1 and 2.

## The final document
The final document shall be a complete academic prepress paper that utilizes the latex template in the projec folder exactly as-is. It will merge the derivation document with no omissions or changes of any kind, except to incorporate with it the additional explanation above of introducing an inertial relativity and then the space-time equivalence definition. At the appropriate spots, of course.
