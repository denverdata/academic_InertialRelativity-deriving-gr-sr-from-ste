Abstrect:In this paper I take on thec concept of the point-mass as it is used in physics and mathematics. The point-mass notion is a useful conceptial vehicle for modeling many things, such as the motion of planets, the behavior of particles, and the dynamics of systems. However, the literal interpretation of a point-mass as an actual physical entity with zero dimensions is problematic and leads to misconceptions. I explain the background o this copncept, it's practical uses, where it had been used indorrectly and why, and the implications in physics of thsi misconception.

Introduction: How is singularity considered mathematically historically? When did the noptopn of a physial singluarluty emerge? Why did it emerge? How did it become part of mainstream physics? What are the implicaitons of thsi potential mosconception in physics and mathematics? In short, they have led to 75 years of internally obstructed sciencer as the result of what i believe is a well documernted and easily traced to what amounts to a marketing compaign in place of scientific rigor. A systematic campaign to establish prevalence of their theory, under the preseumptomn that they could only be correct, and therefore the ends justified the means.

What is a point-maas, and how it it used?

How does mathematica look at point mass?

Why is this is a problem?
If interpreted ligterally, the point-mass notion leads to several conceptual and practical problems.
# It presumes that wneh somethign gets really small. it can be treated as having no dimensions at all. While small propertiers can certainly becomes neglegible relative to other numbers, insignificance does not equal non-existence. 
# It conflates a visual phenomenon with a physical one. Because somethign apperas not to have dimensions is a perceptive challenge. For example, if we look at the stars, they seem all to be points. and this appearence roots in out visual resolition, where beynnd a certain visual size, we have insufficient visual precision to distinguish spatial extent of the object. We cannot distinguish extentt, therefore it has none. But if we look through a telescope, they all have a clear extent.

Whats the affect of this misconception?
* limits are incorrectly interprteted as physically rechable
* Physical point mass singularities are thought to exist
* We believe that at some point things no longer have spatial extent.
* We treat divisoin by zero as a failure of the principle,a "blow up", rather than the obvious, a failure to use the math correctly.
* Division by zero is a product of a mathematical misconceptn, not a blow up of anuything. The notion of divison by zero itself is a mathematical fallacy that only emerges from equating very small to 0. If one isgetting a dividionby zero, they are sayijng they want to know what fraction of 0 a number is. Well, it's not zero.
* Rather than equating the absence of singularities in mathematics as a proof of the absence of singularities in physics, lambda cdm physicists
sought to redefime mathematics. That chice of path, in my opinion, points not to inept physicists, but rather, a crafty technique to artifically boost the perceived merits of their theory. That's a lot of work that someone not aimed at deception would not need to do. There are two names on the paper, hinmting that this objective reprewnted a coordinated effort, or "conspiracy" under the legal definition of that term.
Why and how did this get into mainstream physics
The ideal of a singularity became essential to interpreting cosmic redshift as expansion. Expansion implies a point origin, and mathematics does not support the concept of so very smart modern physicists moved to reduce the debate in physics and by overly embellishing a theory that they believed to be corect, and thus, to them, the ends justified the means. And that would have been true, had they been correct with their throry. course, it's important to be correct or it would seem as an attack on scierntific rigor.
All other theories about the behaior of the universe became "alternative", at term that has been widely used to deflate the merits of a different opinion. Ongoing research had to start a more philosophical level liek string theory, becsuse after all, the standard model. "The Big Bang", that was all fact. That was entire generationf of physicists limiting their hypothetical work because others cast that realm of exploration laughable. that was a crime in my opinion.
Physicists had to endure nonsesniocal explamnatoions offered as fact by people respected as physicists. This producted a disconnection between the perception of science and the actuality.
This rendered the scientific method simply a popularity contest. Someting opposite to the intent of the scientific method. 
We took the time to understand the world worse, during a pivotal time in human evolution. In human survival. We built bombs we had no real idea how they worked. Talk about irresponsibe,  putting the cart before the horse in the most extreme way.
THis ultimateld caused the disimtogratopm pf meaningful scientific reasearch, very likely a component to the United States' departure from science. If it makes no sense and cant be challenged, what can one really discover?

Einstein's Perspective
Einstein did not support the inclusion of singluarities into his theory, I believe there was substantial pressue, and when these efforts failed, the waited for Enisteins death to plot their integration with Relativity. I know this because they were wrong. Had they been right, this "conspiracy" to tether to relativity while casting the view that they were one-and-the same. 

Mathematic's perspective:
It's really simple. As x-> infinity. (as x approaches infinity, because it can only be approached, it is not a number but the absence of a limit), 1/x->0. What that means is that as x keep getting bigger, 1/x keeps getting smaller, forever. As such, when somethign approaches 0 from 1, it will approach - forever. But is also descriobes an important limit, something that approahes 0 is unambiguously NEVER greater than or equal to 0. That is the literal definition of a limit. To intrepret the an approach that ever reaches its limit is inonsistent with the stated definition of a mathematical limit. The preceding statement is literally all that is required for this paper. All other content is to help ease in this very stark fact. 

The Singluarity proof:
While I would not even neet to look at it. But I did, and as expected, it lays out a condition that can omnlu be achieved under their premise, which is not a valid premise in my model. This could paint a picture of equiovbalemnt models, had the alternative model not releide on cyclic logic and mathematical falsities. But as any worthy scientist, I leave all of my logic at the scrutiny of fellow scientists. I welcome authentic and credible challendges, and could possibly have made it this distance without the abilitu to be CONSTANTLY WRONG at every step of the process. Becasue every time you are wrong, there is oppoprtiunituy to get smarter. Being right offers no such opportunity. Social games offer little path to authentic discoery.
