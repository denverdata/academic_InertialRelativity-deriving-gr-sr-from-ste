Visionary, Innovator, Solutions Architect3000 Lawrence Street, Suite 113, Denver, Colorado 80205[tom.degerlia@coloradodigital.com](mailto:tom.degerlia@coloradodigital.com) | 303.587.7942

### Professional Summary:

I am an experienced technologist and leader, having founded and led Colorado Digital, a Denver-based web dev and marketing agency, for close to 25 years. I recently outgrew my role at Colorado Digital, and I am an active expert consultant in data/software/AI, supporting corporations as well as the legal industry and courts. I am currently seeking new challenges within forward-thinking organizations that contribute to a prosperous, inclusive future.

### Core Beliefs:

*   Abundance: I believe we are in a world abundant with resources and opportunities, and there is no such thing as a competitor. To see another as a competitor is to ignore a chance to collaborate and grow.
    
*   Authenticity: I am transparent of intent and will take the time to explain where I’m coming from or to understand your perspective.
    
*   Respect: I believe in trust. That is not synonymous with being gullible. Disrespect and distrust are mechanisms of superiority, and those serve counter to effective collaboration and team building. These sentiments are always reciprocated, whether overtly or covertly. A pivotal component of trust is empowerment, allowing those on your team the authority to take responsibility for the objective they have before them while providing them the necessary support to do so correctly and efficiently.
    
*   Practicality: I live in the real world and solve problems with practical, attainable solutions. Solutions are often found in unpredictable places or use novel or unprecedented techniques but never rely on wishful thinking.
    

### I am a Problem Solver:

I am optimistic, confident, capable, caring, and engaged. I am enthusiastic to meet new people and solve new problems. I am relentless in my pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the world around me. I take every opportunity to exercise my brain, and I am willing and capable of learning almost anything with sufficient time. While I am not compelled to lead, I have the mindset of a leader, whether leading a team of one or many. I take responsibility, I share in the load where I am most needed, valuable, and capable, and I extend respect and trust to the people who share that team. I operate strategically, always from goals, and I observe and measure the outcome. I am creative, and I make an experiment out of almost every decision I make. I am prepared to form an opinion, and that opinion is derived from my values and shaped by practical wisdom assembled from experimental observation. I am not always right, but I always learn. My values are this, in a nutshell: we are in an abundant world in which we are all more valuable working together than working against each other, and thus, principles of harmony guide me: love, care, understanding, trust, gratitude, fairness, respect, objectivity, and constructive honesty. I understand people and can usually read them well. Conversely, some friends have expressed that I am not initially easy to read - until we learned each other's mode of communication and established some rapport. I work well with most people, even those considered to have challenging personalities; I am able to see past their shield to the admirable person inside. I am unafraid to challenge convention - every day, we follow practices that are millennia old without considering how to do things better. I am intellectually competitive but not more intelligent than anyone else; I believe that everyone is a genius in their realm. I keep my eyes open for the silver lining because there always is one. Life is what you make of it, and I know I need only perceive something as awesome for it to be, making me a “glass is half full” guy. I regularly assess and recognize areas where I wish to achieve different outcomes. I learn many new things every day. I am not driven by money, however, I value my time and understand the potential value of it to a well-aligned objective to which I am empowered and committed. I maintain a work-life balance and honor my personal life, but at the same time, I am always ready to roll up my sleeves and do whatever is necessary to get the job done. My persistence is unbounded.

### Education:

*   Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Mathematics, Metropolitan State University of Denver.
    
*   Master of Science in Chemistry (partially complete), University of Colorado Denver.
    
*   Master of Science in Software Engineering and Algorithms (in my first year), University of Colorado Denver.

'''Tom DeGerlia Visionary, Innovator, Solutions Architect 3000 Lawrence Street, Suite 113, Denver, Colorado 80205 [tom.degerlia@coloradodigital.com](mailto:tom.degerlia@coloradodigital.com) | 303.587.7942 Professional Summary: I am an experienced technologist and leader, having founded and led Colorado Digital, a Denver-based web dev and marketing agency, for close to 25 years. I recently outgrew my role at Colorado Digital, and I am an active expert consultant in data/software/AI, supporting corporations as well as the legal industry and courts. I am currently seeking new challenges within forward-thinking organizations that contribute to a prosperous, inclusive future. Core Beliefs: Abundance: I believe we are in a world abundant with resources and opportunities, and there is no such thing as a competitor. To see another as a competitor is to ignore a chance to collaborate and grow. Authenticity: I am transparent of intent and will take the time to explain where I’m coming from or to understand your perspective. Respect: I believe in trust. That is not synonymous with being gullible. Disrespect and distrust are mechanisms of superiority, and those serve counter to effective collaboration and team building. These sentiments are always reciprocated, whether overtly or covertly. A pivotal element to trust is empowerment, allowing those on your team the authority to take responsibility for the objective they have before them while providing them the necessary support to do so correctly and efficiently. Practicality: I live in the real world and solve problems with practical, attainable solutions. Solutions are often found in unpredictable places or use novel or unprecedented techniques but never rely on wishful thinking. I am a Problem Solver: I am optimistic, confident, capable, caring, and engaged. I am enthusiastic to meet new people and solve new problems. I am relentless in my pursuit of knowledge and understanding of the world around me. I take every opportunity to exercise my brain, and I am willing and capable of learning almost anything with sufficient time. While I am not compelled to lead, I have the mindset of a leader, whether leading a team of one or many. I take responsibility, I share in the load where I am most needed, valuable, and capable, and I extend respect and trust to the people who share that team. I operate strategically, always from goals, and I observe and measure the outcome. I am creative, and I make an experiment out of almost every decision I make. I am prepared to form an opinion, and that opinion is derived from my values and shaped by practical wisdom assembled from experimental observation. I am not always right, but I always learn. My values are this, in a nutshell: we are in an abundant world in which we are all more valuable working together than working against each other, and thus, principles of harmony guide me: love, care, understanding, trust, gratitude, fairness, respect, objectivity, and constructive honesty. I understand people and can usually read them well. Conversely, some friends have expressed that I am not initially easy to read - until we learned each other's mode of communication and established some rapport. I work well with most people, even those considered to have challenging personalities; I am able to see past their shield to the admirable person inside. I am unafraid to challenge convention - every day, we follow practices that are millennia old without considering how to do things better. I am intellectually competitive but not more intelligent than anyone else; I believe that everyone is a genius in their realm. I keep my eyes open for the silver lining because there always is one. Life is what you make of it, and I know I need only perceive something as awesome for it to be, making me a “glass is half full” guy. I regularly assess and recognize areas where I wish to achieve different outcomes. I learn many new things every day. I am not driven by money, however, I value my time and understand the potential value of it to a well-aligned objective to which I am empowered and committed. I maintain a work-life balance and honor my personal life, but at the same time, I am always ready to roll up my sleeves and do whatever is necessary to get the job done. My persistence is unbounded. Education: Bachelor of Science in Chemistry and Mathematics, Metropolitan State University of Denver. Master of Science in Chemistry (In Progress), University of Colorado Denver. Master of Science in Software Engineering and Algorithms (In Progress), University of Colorado Denver. Professional Experience: DeGerlia Expert Consulting, Denver, Colorado Founder and Senior Expert Consultant 2018 to Present Support for Attorneys and Courts Utilizing proprietary AI techniques to request, extract, interpret, organize, analyze, and draw conclusions from discovery data. Derive maximum substantive value from often difficult-to-utilize discovery data. Court settlement monitoring associated with software engineering and data systems - Supplementing class-action lawsuit settlement fulfillment. Expert witness, expert testimony - In software engineering, databases, data and data formats, data compliance, accessibility, software quality assurance, agile and traditional project management, data reliability, data interpretation, and quantification. Forensics - Finding a needle in a haystack of technology and data. Tom has experience in forensic analysis that can bridge physical sciences with computer science. Root cause analysis for system failures or responsibility identification. Defensibility auditing - Risk mitigation analysis of sensitive systems. Support for Businesses Business AI integration and automation consulting Complex problem solving - Applying interdisciplinary domain knowledge, tools, and techniques to solve complex challenges. There’s no problem I won't attack with objectivity, confidence, focus, and persistence. More often than not, I can offer practical solutions. Approaching challenges outside of my experience often produces success where insiders cannot break free of established patterns of thought. Colorado Digital, Denver, Colorado President, Senior Digital Strategist 2020 to 2023 Manage and support director level personnel on the Denverdata staff including the Director of Engineering, the Director of Business Development, and the Operations Manager Champion the internal adoption of AI and machine learning tools and techniques.
